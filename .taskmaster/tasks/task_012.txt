# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations for handling large codebases and ensuring sub-5 second response times.
# Details:
1. Implement codebase chunking for large repositories:
   ```typescript
   function chunkCodebase(codebase: string, maxChunkSize: number): string[] {
     // Intelligently split codebase into chunks
     // Prioritize keeping related files together
   }
   ```
2. Add caching layer for repomix results
3. Implement parallel processing where applicable
4. Add response time monitoring
5. Optimize Gemini API requests for faster responses

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance with various codebase sizes. Test chunking algorithm with large codebases. Measure response times with and without caching. Verify parallel processing improves performance for applicable operations.
