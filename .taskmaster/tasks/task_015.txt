# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive testing framework including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.
# Details:
1. Setup testing framework with Jest or Mocha
2. Implement unit tests for all components
3. Create integration tests for end-to-end workflows
4. Develop performance benchmarking tests
5. Implement test fixtures and mocks:
   ```typescript
   // Example mock for GeminiClient
   const mockGeminiClient = {
     reviewPlan: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
       taskId: 'task-123',
       reviewType: 'plan',
       overallScore: 8,
       feedback: {
         summary: 'Good plan overall',
         strengths: ['Well structured', 'Follows best practices'],
         concerns: ['Potential performance issue'],
         suggestions: ['Consider caching results']
       },
       metadata: {
         codebaseSize: 10000,
         reviewTimestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
         modelUsed: 'gemini-1.5-pro'
       }
     }),
     reviewImplementation: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(/* ... */)
   };
   ```

# Test Strategy:
Run the test suite regularly during development. Measure test coverage and aim for >80% coverage. Verify all critical paths are tested. Run performance tests with various codebase sizes to ensure performance requirements are met.
